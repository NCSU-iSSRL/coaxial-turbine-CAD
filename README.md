## Coaxial Turbine
The tethered coaxial turbine is a potential solution for extracting hydrokinetic energy from the flow of the Gulf Stream. The turbine consists of two rotors attached to either side of a generator that  counter-rotate in opposite directions to induce power in the generator. Current research pertains to steady and dynamic analysis of the systems, and tow testing of the turbine in an open-water environment.

This repository hosts CAD files for various NCSU-iSSRL Coaxial Turbine projects.
