## Coaxial Turbine
The tethered Coaxial Turbine is a solution for extracting hydrokinetic energy from the flow resources, like the Gulf Stream. The turbine consists of two counter-spinning rotors attached to either side of a generator. Current research pertains to steady and dynamic analysis of the systems and tow testing of the turbine in an open-water environment.

This repository hosts CAD files for various NCSU-iSSRL Coaxial Turbine projects.
